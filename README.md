In this project, I used Power BI to analyze and visualize ShopNest's sales, product performance, and delivery data:

1. Data Cleaning & Preparation: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and corrected data types to ensure clean and accurate datasets for analysis.
2. Data Modeling: Established relationships between datasets and created calculated columns and measures using DAX to perform advanced analysis.
3. Interactive Visualizations: Developed dashboards with interactive slicers, filters, and drill-through features for a detailed analysis of key metrics such as on-time vs. delayed deliveries.
4. Performance Indicators: Calculated key performance indicators (KPIs), including profit margins, to provide insights into product and delivery performance.
5. User-Centric Design: Focused on intuitive dashboard layout and design, ensuring ease of use for stakeholders to explore data and make data-driven decisions.
 
This project demonstrates my ability to work with complex datasets, create interactive visualizations, and provide actionable insights using Power BI.
